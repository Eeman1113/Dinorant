# Dinorant

Welcome to **Dinorant** - a fun and quirky project where we train an AI to play the classic Chrome Dinosaur game! With Dinorant, we've combined the excitement of gaming with the power of artificial intelligence to create an entertaining experience. Let's dive in and see what this project is all about!

## What is Dinorant?

Dinorant is a project aimed at creating an AI agent that can autonomously play the Chrome Dinosaur game. Using reinforcement learning techniques, we train our AI to jump over obstacles and survive as long as possible in the game. It's a blend of cutting-edge technology and retro gaming nostalgia!

## Getting Started

To get started with Dinorant, follow these simple steps:

1. **Installation:** Install the required dependencies using the provided instructions in the code.

2. **Environment Setup:** We've built a custom environment to simulate the Chrome Dinosaur game. This environment allows our AI agent to interact with the game and learn from its actions.

3. **Training the Model:** Use the provided training script to train the AI model. The model learns to play the game through trial and error, gradually improving its performance over time.

4. **Testing the Model:** Once the model is trained, test it out in the game environment. Watch as the AI autonomously navigates through the game, dodging obstacles and racking up points!

## How Does Dinorant Work?

Dinorant utilizes several key components to train and test the AI agent:

- **Custom Environment:** We've created a custom environment using the Gym library, tailored to mimic the Chrome Dinosaur game. The environment provides observations and action spaces for the AI agent.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** The AI agent learns to play the game using reinforcement learning techniques, optimizing its actions to maximize cumulative rewards.
- **Model Training:** We use the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm to train the AI model. The model learns from experience, adjusting its action-selection policy over time.
- **Testing Mode:** After training, switch to testing mode to see how well the AI performs in the actual game environment. Evaluate its performance based on metrics such as score and survival duration.

## Features

- **Custom Environment:** Tailored environment for training and testing the AI agent.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** AI learns to play the game through trial and error, optimizing its actions for maximum rewards.
- **Training Callbacks:** Save model progress and monitor performance during training with callbacks.
- **Testing Mode:** Evaluate AI performance in the actual game environment post-training.
